                <p>Well, now that I've had a chance to reconfigure this blog section of the website, I've had much more practice with beginner Python commands. I will say, once I got the hang of the basic commands used for this site, it really was a matter of repeating those same commands repeatedly. I'm sure my code isn't that efficient, but it did allow someone with a limited set of commands to build out the website with a large degree fo flexibility. I can see how with an expanded set of commands, this could get pretty fun!
