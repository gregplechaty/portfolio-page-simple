                <p>Part of what makes coding terrifying is the interconnectness of coding languages. Python, by itself, is taught with small logic puzzles. I supposed this is why html is a common starting point: not only is it extremely simple, but you can create a' mvp' (minimally viable product) by itself. Add a little CSS, and you have a website that looks like it was plucked from then 90s.</p>
